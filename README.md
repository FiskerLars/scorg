Science Organiser (Contacts, Publications, Conferences, Projectsâ€¦)

[this currently is the backup-my-work-somewhere version]

As soon as the UI is running this will help to organise contacts and
conferences. I want to create a RDF-Store where I can collect data on
people I consider contacts and the conferences (or other events) where I
meet them. 

In Version 2 I want to include my literature archive to organise
publications read (or written) by me as well as related citation graphs.
Further I want to view the relations to my contacts and the conferences.

Version 3 will probably be used to track my current projects (which
often is somehow related to conference or journal deadlines).

L.F.
